# Garden-Project

## Overview

The automated garden is run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM. It has multiple soil moisture sensors, and I recently added a temperature/humidity sensor. All the data will be stored on a second Raspberry Pi that I use as an SQL server. The goal of this automated garden is to gain a better understanding of the Raspberry Pi, with the long-term goal of turning it into an automated greenhouse. There are several other things that I would need to make that happen, but these are the early stages of the process. I do plan on adding documentation to this project once I get further along in the process.
